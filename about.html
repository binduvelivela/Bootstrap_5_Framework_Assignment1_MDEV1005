                  Mosses live on the surface soils in deserts all across the
                  world. A cool thing about moss is that they have the ability
                  to capture water straight out of the air using these
                  specialized structures that look like little hairs coming out
                  of their leaves—called awns," USGS research ecologist Sasha
                  Reed, tells Popular Mechanics. "In the dry places that these
                  mosses live, this is a pretty cool trick!

                  Earth is a giant heat engine. Heat from the Sun is absorbed
                  where it is warm (the low latitudes and the surface) and heat
                  is radiated as infrared where it is cold (the higher latitudes
                  and the atmosphere)," Andy Ingersoll, a planetary scientist at
                  Caltech, tells Popular Mechanics. "The work of the heat engine
                  goes into the kinetic energy of winds and storms.

                <p class="card-text">
                  The length of Earth's day is increasing. When Earth was formed
                  4.6 billion years ago, its day would have been roughly six
                  hours long. By 620 million years ago, this had increased to
                  21.9 hours. Today, the average day is 24 hours long, but is
                  increasing by about 1.7 milliseconds every century. The
                  reason? The moon is slowing down Earth's rotation through the
                  tides that it helps create. Earth's spin causes the position
                  of its tidal ocean bulges to be pulled slightly ahead of the
                  moon-Earth axis, which creates a twisting force that slows
                  down Earth's rotation. As a result, our day is getting longer
                  — but not long enough to make a difference to your busy
                  schedule.
